# Antigravity Configuration

This directory contains configuration, rules, and workflows for the **Antigravity** agent engine.

## Structure

- **`protocols/`**: Definitions of agent protocols (how agents should behave).
- **`rules/`**: Custom rules injected into the agent's context.
- **`scripts/`**: Helper scripts used by the agent configuration (e.g., watchdogs).
- **`workflows/`**: Workflow definitions (e.g., `/fix-github`) that chain agent actions.
