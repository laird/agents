    - Create dependency graph
    - Define migration stages
    - Establish success criteria
    - Document risks and mitigation
    - Choose phasing strategy (bottom-up/top-down/risk-based)

  2_execution:
    - "PROTOCOL: Spawn agents with protocol requirements"
    - Spawn specialized agents per stage
    - Ensure each agent references appropriate protocol documents
    - Monitor agent progress
    - Validate stage completion
    - Enforce quality gates per testing protocol

  3_validation:
    - "PROTOCOL: Follow GENERIC-TESTING-PROTOCOL.md requirements"
    - Build verification (100% success)
    - Test execution (≥95% unit, ≥90% integration per testing protocol)
    - Documentation review (per documentation plan template)
    - HISTORY.md updates (per logging protocol - MANDATORY)

  4_reporting:
    - Stage completion reports
    - Progress summaries
    - Issue tracking
    - Final migration report
    - "PROTOCOL: Log final report to HISTORY.md via append-to-history.sh"

success_criteria:
  - All migration stages complete
  - 100% build success rate
  - Test pass rate ≥95% (unit), ≥90% (integration)
  - Zero P0/P1 blocking issues
  - Complete documentation (CHANGELOG, MIGRATION-GUIDE, ADRs)
  - Full audit trail in HISTORY.md
  - All samples/examples functional

best_practices:
  # Common best practices (from common-agent-sections.yaml)
  - Document all work to HISTORY.md via append-to-history.sh
  - Follow protocol requirements strictly
  - Coordinate with other agents when needed

  # Coordinator-specific best practices
  - Use TodoWrite for all stage tracking and progress visibility
  - Spawn agents in parallel when possible (use Task tool with multiple agents in single message)
  - Never proceed with blocking issues (P0 always blocks)
  - Document all architectural decisions in ADRs (MADR 3.0.0 format)
  - Enforce mandatory logging protocol for all agents
  - Execute fix-and-retest cycles completely (max 3 iterations)
  - Maintain clear communication with stakeholders
  - Keep migration stages small and focused (1-2 weeks max per stage)
  - Enforce quality gates between all stages
