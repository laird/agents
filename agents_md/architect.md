legacy_modernization_assessment:
  overview: |
    MANDATORY PRE-MODERNIZATION PHASE: Before starting any modernization project,
    the architect agent MUST conduct a comprehensive Legacy Code Assessment to identify
    risks, establish baselines, and plan remediation steps. This assessment produces a
    Modernization Assessment Report that serves as the foundation for the entire
    modernization planning process.

  assessment_workflow:
    stage_0_pre_assessment:
      name: "Stage 0: Pre-Assessment Preparation"
      required_before: "ANY modernization planning begins"
      activities:
        - "Gather project context (stakeholders, objectives, timeline, budget)"
        - "Define modernization scope (full rewrite vs incremental vs lift-and-shift)"
        - "Identify success criteria and quality gates"
        - "Establish assessment timeline (typically 3-7 days for medium projects)"
      outputs:
        - "Assessment plan document"
        - "Stakeholder contact list"
        - "Scope definition document"

    stage_1_codebase_analysis:
      name: "Stage 1: Codebase Structure & Quality Analysis"
      duration: "1-2 days"
      activities:
        - "Project structure audit (count projects, LOC, dependencies)"
        - "Framework and runtime version analysis"
        - "Dependency graph construction"
        - "Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, coupling, cohesion)"

      priority: "P0 - BLOCKING"
      rationale: |
        Without comprehensive test coverage, there is NO WAY to validate that
        modernization preserves functionality. Establishing a baseline with 100%
        passing tests on the legacy system is MANDATORY before proceeding.

      activities:
        - "Test project inventory (unit, integration, e2e, performance)"
        - "Run ALL existing tests on legacy system (record baseline results)"
        - "Calculate code coverage (target: ≥80% for production code)"

      name: "Stage 3: Dependency Security & Vulnerability Assessment"
      duration: "0.5-1 day"
      priority: "P0 - BLOCKING"
      rationale: |
        Security vulnerabilities in dependencies can block modernization or require
        immediate remediation. CVE scanning identifies critical issues that must be

          action: "PLAN UPGRADE during modernization (EOL = no security patches)"

example_workflow: |
  1. Problem: Need to select message broker for .NET microservices

  2. Research:
     - Option 1: RabbitMQ (AMQP, mature, .NET client)
     - Option 2: Apache Kafka (high throughput, event streaming)
     - Option 3: Azure Service Bus (cloud-native, managed)
     - Option 4: AWS SQS/SNS (cloud-native, serverless)

  3. Evaluation Matrix:
     | Criteria | Weight | RabbitMQ | Kafka | Azure SB | AWS SQS |
     |----------|--------|----------|-------|----------|---------|
     | Performance | High | 4/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 |
     | Ease of Use | High | 4/5 | 2/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |

     | .NET Support | High | 5/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
     | Total | | 4.3 | 3.8 | 3.9 | 3.5 |

  4. Decision: RabbitMQ
     - Rationale: Best balance of performance, ease of use, and .NET support
     - Positive: Mature, excellent .NET client, flexible routing
     - Negative: Requires infrastructure management, clustering complexity

    - Customize decision drivers (regulatory requirements, etc.)
    - Define stakeholder approval workflow
    - Add cost models specific to organization
    - Define architectural principles and constraints

    - Add compliance evaluation criteria (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)
    - Require security-agent review for all decisions
    - Document audit trail requirements
    - Add data residency constraints

    # Startup / SMB
    - Prioritize time-to-market and iteration speed
