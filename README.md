# Modernize - Claude Code Plugin

A **Claude Code plugin** providing production-validated protocols, specialized agents, and automation frameworks for systematic AI-assisted software modernization and development.

## Overview

This plugin provides a complete modernization workflow (assess ‚Üí plan ‚Üí execute ‚Üí improve) with 6 specialized agents and comprehensive protocol documentation. Features **continuous improvement** through retrospective analysis that learns from agent mistakes and user corrections. Originally created for .NET framework migrations, these tools are **universally applicable** to any software project requiring structured agent collaboration.

---

## Installation

**Install as Claude Code plugin**:

1. Clone this repository or copy the `commands/` directory to your project
2. Commands will be available as slash commands in Claude Code
3. Start with `/assess` to evaluate your project

---

## What's Included

### 5 Slash Commands
- **`/assess`** - Assess project viability for modernization (outputs `assessment.md`)
- **`/plan`** - Create detailed execution plan (outputs `plan.md`)
- **`/modernize`** - Orchestrate multi-agent modernization workflow
- **`/retro`** - Retrospective analysis to identify process improvements (outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md`)
- **`/retro-apply`** - Apply approved process improvements from retrospective

### Comprehensive Documentation
Each command includes detailed protocols with:
- **Multi-agent coordination** - 6 specialist agents work together (Coordinator, Security, Architect, Coder, Tester, Documentation)
- **Phase-by-phase workflows** - Step-by-step execution with clear deliverables
- **Quality gates** - Automated validation and blocking criteria
- **Best practices** - Anti-patterns, troubleshooting, examples
- **Continuous improvement** - Retrospective analysis and automated application of lessons learned

---

## Quick Start

### Modernization Workflow

1. **Assess Viability**
   ```
   /assess
   ```
   Evaluates technical debt, risks, and ROI. Outputs `assessment.md`.

2. **Create Plan**
   ```
   /plan
   ```
   Develops detailed execution strategy with phases, timeline, and resources. Outputs `plan.md`.

3. **Execute Modernization**
   ```
   /modernize
   ```
   Orchestrates specialized agents through 7 phases:
   - Discovery & Planning
   - Security Assessment
   - Architecture Decisions
   - Framework Upgrade
   - API Modernization
   - Performance Optimization
   - Documentation

4. **Continuous Improvement (Optional)**
   ```
   /retro
   ```
   After project completion, analyzes history to identify process improvements. Reviews:
   - User interruptions and corrections
   - Agent behavioral issues (wrong tools, wasted effort)
   - Protocol inefficiencies
   - Automation opportunities

   Outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md` with 3-5 evidence-based recommendations.

5. **Apply Improvements**
   ```
   /retro-apply
   ```
   Systematically applies approved recommendations from `IMPROVEMENTS.md`:
   - Updates command files with better agent behavior guidance
   - Modifies protocols to prevent recurring issues
   - Adds automation (scripts, hooks, CI/CD)
   - Embeds lessons learned into workflow

### Using Agents

Agents are invoked by Claude Code's Task tool when needed. They work together following established protocols:

- **Architect** makes technology decisions and creates ADRs
- **Security** scans for vulnerabilities and blocks on CRITICAL/HIGH issues
- **Coder** implements migrations and fixes
- **Tester** validates with comprehensive test suites (100% pass rate required)
- **Documentation** generates user-facing guides and changelogs
- **Migration Coordinator** orchestrates multi-stage workflows

## Best Practices

### For New Projects
1. Install the plugin by copying `commands/` to your project
2. Run `/assess` to evaluate modernization readiness
3. Run `/plan` to create execution strategy
4. Run `/modernize` to orchestrate the work
5. Monitor HISTORY.md for complete audit trail
6. Run `/retro` after completion to identify improvements
7. Run `/retro-apply` to embed lessons learned

### Continuous Improvement Workflow
1. Complete a modernization project with `/modernize`
2. Run `/retro` to analyze what happened:
   - Reviews git history for user corrections
   - Identifies agent behavioral issues
   - Finds protocol inefficiencies
   - Quantifies impact of improvements
3. Review `IMPROVEMENTS.md` with team
4. Run `/retro-apply` to implement approved changes
5. Next project automatically benefits from improvements

### For Existing Projects
1. Install the plugin
2. Start with `/assess` to understand scope
3. Use `/plan` to create detailed execution strategy
4. Leverage multi-agent coordination with `/modernize`
5. Apply continuous improvement with `/retro` and `/retro-apply`

### Quality Gates to Enforce
