# Modernize - Claude Code Plugin

A **Claude Code plugin** providing production-validated protocols, specialized agents, and automation frameworks for systematic AI-assisted software modernization and development.

## Overview

This plugin provides a complete modernization workflow (assess ‚Üí plan ‚Üí execute ‚Üí improve) with 6 specialized agents and comprehensive protocol documentation. Features **continuous improvement** through retrospective analysis that learns from agent mistakes and user corrections. Created originally for .NET framework migrations, these tools are **universally applicable** to any software project requiring structured agent collaboration.

## Installation

**Install as Claude Code plugin**:

1. Use the /plugin command in claude code, and add this repo as a marketplace, then add the modernize plugin.
2. Commands will be available as slash commands in Claude Code

## What's Included

### 5 Protocol-Based Commands

Each command is a comprehensive protocol document (`.md` file) containing agent coordination, workflows, quality gates, and best practices:

- **`/assess`** - Assessment protocol with viability evaluation (outputs `ASSESSMENT.md`)
  - 8 assessment dimensions, scoring methodology, recommendation matrix
  - Do this first to assess software for potential modernization

- **`/plan`** - Planning protocol with detailed execution strategy (outputs `PLAN.md`)
  - Phase breakdown, timeline estimation, risk management, resource allocation
  - Do this to propose a modernization plan

- **`/modernize`** - Full modernization protocol with 7-phase workflow
  - Coordinates 6 specialist agents through Discovery ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Framework ‚Üí API ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Documentation
  - Do this to execute the plan. If there is no plan it will generate a plan and then execute it.

- **`/retro`** - Retrospective protocol analyzing project history (outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md`)
  - Reviews git history, user corrections, agent mistakes, protocol inefficiencies
  - Do this after execution to assess how the project went and make improvement recommendations for future projects. This is optional.

- **`/retro-apply`** - Improvement application protocol
  - Systematically updates commands, protocols, and automation based on retrospective findings
  - Do this after `/retro` if you agree with the recommendations.

### What's Inside Each Protocol

Every command file includes:
- **Agent coordination instructions** - How 6 specialist agents work together (Migration Coordinator, Security, Architect, Coder, Tester, Documentation)
- **Phase-by-phase workflows** - Detailed steps with durations, deliverables, and success criteria
- **Quality gates** - Blocking criteria and validation checkpoints
- **Examples** - Real-world scenarios and usage patterns
- **Anti-patterns** - What NOT to do with explanations
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Best practices** - Proven approaches and recommendations

## Quick Start

### Modernization Workflow

1. **Assess Viability**
   ```
   /assess
   ```
   Evaluates technical debt, risks, and ROI. Outputs `ASSESSMENT.md`.

2. **Create Plan**
   ```
   /plan
   ```
   Develops detailed execution strategy with phases, timeline, and resources. Outputs `PLAN.md`.

3. **Execute Modernization**
   ```
   /modernize
   ```
   Orchestrates specialized agents through 7 phases:
   - Discovery & Planning
   - Security Assessment
   - Architecture Decisions
   - Framework Upgrade
   - API Modernization
   - Performance Optimization
   - Documentation

4. **Continuous Improvement (Optional)**
   ```
   /retro
   ```
   After project completion, analyzes history to identify process improvements. Reviews:
   - User interruptions and corrections
   - Agent behavioral issues (wrong tools, wasted effort)
   - Protocol inefficiencies
   - Automation opportunities

   Outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md` with 3-5 evidence-based recommendations.

5. **Apply Improvements**
   ```
   /retro-apply
   ```
   Systematically applies approved recommendations from `IMPROVEMENTS.md`:
   - Updates command files with better agent behavior guidance
   - Modifies protocols to prevent recurring issues
   - Adds automation (scripts, hooks, CI/CD)
   - Embeds lessons learned into workflow

### Using Agents

Agents are invoked by Claude Code's Task tool when needed. They work together following established protocols:

- **Architect** makes technology decisions and creates ADRs
- **Security** scans for vulnerabilities and blocks on CRITICAL/HIGH issues
- **Coder** implements migrations and fixes
- **Tester** validates with comprehensive test suites (100% pass rate required)
- **Documentation** generates user-facing guides and changelogs
- **Migration Coordinator** orchestrates multi-stage workflows

## Repository Structure

```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assess.md               # Assessment protocol with agent coordination

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retro-apply.md          # Improvement application protocol

```

**Note**: Each command file IS a comprehensive protocol document containing:
- Complete phase-by-phase workflows
- Agent coordination instructions (Migration Coordinator, Security, Architect, Coder, Tester, Documentation)
- Quality gates and success criteria
- Examples, anti-patterns, and troubleshooting
- Best practices and implementation guidance

Previous versions had separate `agents/`, `protocols/`, and `scripts/` directories. These have been consolidated into the command files for a streamlined structure.
