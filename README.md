```

### Recommended Companion Plugins

These plugins enhance the capabilities of modernize and autocoder:

| Plugin | Purpose | When to Install |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **superpowers** | Structured problem-solving skills (debugging, planning, verification) | Recommended for complex issues requiring systematic approaches |
| **quint** | Structured reasoning for human-guided decision making | Recommended for ultra-complex decisions requiring human judgment |

**Install recommended plugins:**

```bash
# superpowers - for complex problem-solving
/plugin install superpowers

# quint - for ultra-complex decisions (https://quint.codes/)
/plugin install quint
```

**How they're used:**

- **superpowers**: Automatically invoked by `/fix` for complex issues (>10 test failures, multi-file changes, feature implementations). Provides systematic debugging, brainstorming, planning, and verification skills.

- **quint**: Automatically invoked for ultra-complex issues that exceed autonomous resolution capabilities (>100 test failures, major architecture decisions, irreversible consequences). Guides structured reasoning with human collaboration.

If these plugins are not installed, the workflows use direct problem-solving approaches instead.

## Plugins

### Plugin 1: Modernize

Complete modernization workflow with multi-agent orchestration.

**Get help:** `/modernize-help`

#### 6 Protocol-Based Commands

Each command is a comprehensive protocol document (`.md` file) containing agent coordination, workflows, quality gates, and best practices:

- **`/assess`** - Assessment protocol with viability evaluation (outputs `ASSESSMENT.md`)
  - 8 assessment dimensions, scoring methodology, recommendation matrix
  - Do this first to assess software for potential modernization

- **`/plan`** - Planning protocol with detailed execution strategy (outputs `PLAN.md`)
  - Phase breakdown, timeline estimation, risk management, resource allocation
  - Do this to propose a modernization plan

- **`/modernize`** - Full modernization protocol with 7-phase workflow
  - Coordinates 6 specialist agents through Discovery → Security → Architecture → Framework → API → Performance → Documentation
  - Do this to execute the plan. If there is no plan it will generate a plan and then execute it.

- **`/retro`** - Retrospective protocol analyzing project history (outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md`)
  - Reviews git history, user corrections, agent mistakes, protocol inefficiencies
  - Do this after execution to assess how the project went and make improvement recommendations for future projects. This is optional.

- **`/retro-apply`** - Improvement application protocol
  - Systematically updates commands, protocols, and automation based on retrospective findings
  - Do this after `/retro` if you agree with the recommendations.

#### Quick Start

1. **Assess Viability**

   ```
   /assess
   ```

   Evaluates technical debt, risks, and ROI. Outputs `ASSESSMENT.md`.

2. **Create Plan**

   ```
   /plan
   ```

   Develops detailed execution strategy with phases, timeline, and resources. Outputs `PLAN.md`.

3. **Execute Modernization**

   ```
   /modernize
   ```

   Orchestrates specialized agents through 7 phases:
   - Discovery & Planning
   - Security Assessment
   - Architecture Decisions
   - Framework Upgrade
   - API Modernization
   - Performance Optimization
   - Documentation

4. **Continuous Improvement (Optional)**

   ```
   /retro
   ```

   After project completion, analyzes history to identify process improvements. Reviews:
   - User interruptions and corrections
   - Agent behavioral issues (wrong tools, wasted effort)
   - Protocol inefficiencies
   - Automation opportunities

   Outputs `IMPROVEMENTS.md` with 3-5 evidence-based recommendations.

5. **Apply Improvements**

   ```
   /retro-apply
   ```

   Systematically applies approved recommendations from `IMPROVEMENTS.md`:
   - Updates command files with better agent behavior guidance
   - Modifies protocols to prevent recurring issues
   - Adds automation (scripts, hooks, CI/CD)
   - Embeds lessons learned into workflow

#### Specialist Agents

The modernize plugin includes 6 specialized agents invoked by Claude Code's Task tool:

- **Architect** makes technology decisions and creates ADRs
- **Security** scans for vulnerabilities and blocks on CRITICAL/HIGH issues
- **Coder** implements migrations and fixes
- **Tester** validates with comprehensive test suites (100% pass rate required)
- **Documentation** generates user-facing guides and changelogs
- **Migration Coordinator** orchestrates multi-stage workflows

**Setup:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/install` | Install all autocoder plugin components (stop hook, scripts) |
| `/autocoder-help` | Show help and workflow overview |

#### Workflow Patterns

**Pattern 1: One-Shot Issue Resolution**
```bash
/fix 123      # Fix specific issue
/fix          # Fix highest priority issue
```

**Pattern 2: Continuous Autonomous Mode**
```bash
/install         # First time only (installs stop hook and scripts)
/fix-loop        # Run continuously until /stop-loop
```

**Pattern 3: Design-First Workflow**
```bash
/list-needs-design           # Find issues needing design
/brainstorm-issue 45         # Explore design options
# Review results on GitHub
/fix 45               # Implement after design approval
```

**Pattern 4: Proposal Review**
```bash
/list-proposals              # See AI-generated proposals
/approve-proposal 67         # Approve for implementation
/fix                  # Implements approved proposals
```

**Pattern 5: Parallel Review Session**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run fix loop
/fix-loop

# Terminal 2: Review and unblock issues
/review-blocked              # Review all blocked issues (needs-design, too-complex, etc.)
/review-blocked --label proposal  # Review only proposals
```

#### Priority & Label System

**Priority Labels (P0-P3):**
- **P0**: Critical - system down, security, data loss
- **P1**: High - major feature broken, no workaround
- **P2**: Medium - partial breakage, workaround exists
- **P3**: Low - minor, cosmetic, nice-to-have

**Workflow Labels:**
- `proposal` - AI-generated, awaiting human approval
- `needs-design` - Requires architecture/design work
- `needs-feedback` - Requires human clarification
- `too-complex` - Issue exceeds autonomous resolution scope
- `future` - Deferred for later consideration
- `enhancement` - Feature improvement
- `test-failure` - Created from test failure
- `sre` - Filed by SRE monitoring workflow

#### Human-in-the-Loop Proposal System

AI-generated enhancements are tagged with `proposal` label and require human approval:

1. **Review**: `/list-proposals` shows all pending proposals
2. **Approve**: `/approve-proposal <number>` enables implementation
3. **Feedback**: Comment on GitHub issue, then `/brainstorm-issue <number>`
4. **Reject**: Close the issue with explanation

Proposals are **never auto-implemented** - you control what gets built.

#### SRE Monitoring (Idle Fallback)

When fix-loop has no bugs to fix, enhancements to implement, or proposals to create, autocoder switches to **SRE monitoring mode**:

1. **Production log scanning** - Checks Cloud Logging for errors/warnings in the last 30 minutes
2. **Engagement health checks** - Detects stalled, stuck, or errored engagements
3. **Worker factory heartbeats** - Identifies dead workers before they cause outages
4. **Automated issue filing** - Files new GitHub issues for new error patterns; comments on existing issues
5. **Periodic rechecks** - Waits 15-30 minutes, then restarts the loop

This turns idle time into continuous production monitoring — fixing issues before they escalate.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Get help
/autocoder-help

# Start fixing issues
/fix

# Or run continuously
/install     # one-time setup
/fix-loop
```

**First Run:** Auto-creates configuration in your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Automated Testing & Issue Management

### Regression Test Suite
```bash
npm test
```

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
```
```

Customize these commands for your project's test framework.

**Structure Notes**:

- **Parallel plugin architecture**: Each plugin has its own commands/, agents/, and scripts/
- **Complete separation**: Plugins are independent and can be installed individually
- **Shared agent definitions**: Both plugins include the same 6 specialized agents (architecture, coder, documentation, migration-coordinator, security, tester)
- **Self-contained**: Each plugin can evolve independently without affecting the other

### Recent Protocol Improvements (Nov 2025)

Based on retrospective analysis of RawRabbit modernization, 5 evidence-based improvements were implemented:

1. **Front-Load Test Environment Setup** ⚡
   - Phase 0 test setup now mandatory before any work begins
   - Verified baseline metrics (build, tests, vulnerability scan) replace estimates
   - Prevents "works on my machine" issues discovered too late

2. **Spike-Driven ADR Process** 🧪
   - New Stage 2.5 for high-risk architectural decisions
   - Requires empirical validation via spike branches before commitment
   - 24-48hr stakeholder review period enforced
   - Better decisions through evidence vs. desk research

3. **Shift Security Validation Left** 🔒
   - New automated security scanning protocol
   - Phase 0 baseline scan, continuous monitoring throughout project
   - Security scores calculated from actual scans, never estimated
   - Critical/High CVEs blocked earlier in workflow

4. **Continuous Testing Strategy** ✅
   - Testing after EVERY stage, not delayed until Stage 4
   - Tiered testing: Unit → Component → Integration → Performance
   - Estimated 7 hours saved per project from early issue detection
   - Issues found in Stage 1 vs Stage 4 dramatically cheaper to fix

5. **Incremental Documentation** 📝
   - Status marker system: ⚠️ In Progress → ✅ Fixed (validated) → 📝 Documented
   - "Fixed" claims only after test validation passes
   - Prevents aspirational documentation requiring corrective commits
   - Accurate HISTORY.md audit trail

**Combined Impact**: 27 hours saved per project, earlier issue detection, verified (not estimated) security posture, empirical architectural decisions, and accurate documentation.

## Best Practices

**Modernization Workflow:**

1. `/assess` → `/plan` → `/modernize` → `/retro` → `/retro-apply`
2. Monitor HISTORY.md for complete audit trail
3. Review `IMPROVEMENTS.md` and apply approved changes
4. Next project benefits from lessons learned

**Quality Gates:**

- Security score ≥45 before migration starts
- Build success 100% before next stage
- Test pass rate 100% before proceeding
- All P0/P1 issues resolved before release

**Autocoder Workflow:**

1. Run `/autocoder-help` to see all available commands
2. Run `/fix` to start autonomous issue resolution
3. Use `/list-needs-design` and `/brainstorm-issue` for complex issues
4. Review proposals with `/list-proposals` and approve with `/approve-proposal`
5. For continuous operation: `/install` then `/fix-loop`

---

## Use Cases

- **Framework Upgrades** - .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- **Cloud Migrations** - AWS, Azure, GCP platform changes
- **Language Migrations** - Java to Kotlin, JavaScript to TypeScript
- **Database Migrations** - SQL to NoSQL, version upgrades
- **Legacy Modernization** - Monolith to microservices, API updates
- **Security Remediation** - CVE scanning and vulnerability fixes
- **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Documentation** - Technical docs, migration guides, ADRs
