## How to Use These Specifications

### Option 1: Agent Spawn Instructions

When spawning agents with Claude Code's Task tool, reference the agent specification:

Example: Security Agent
```
You are a security-agent following the specification in: agents/security.md

Your responsibilities:
- Scan for vulnerabilities
- Categorize by severity
- Create remediation plan
- Implement fixes
- Validate with testing
- Document in HISTORY.md

Success criteria:
- All CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs fixed
- Security score ≥45
- Complete security report generated
```

### Option 2: Project Documentation

Reference agent specifications in your project documentation:

Available agents:
- **Security Agent** (`agents/security.md`): CVE scanning, security fixes, scoring
- **Coder Agent** (`agents/coder.md`): Code migration, dependency updates
- **Tester Agent** (`agents/tester.md`): Test execution, 100% pass rate enforcement
- **Documentation Agent** (`agents/documentation.md`): CHANGELOG, migration guides, ADRs
- **Architect Agent** (`agents/architect.md`): Architecture decisions, ADRs
- **Migration Coordinator** (`agents/migration-coordinator.md`): Overall orchestration, quality gates

### Option 3: Multi-Agent Coordination

Use the `/modernize-project` command which coordinates all agents automatically:
- Migration Coordinator orchestrates the workflow
- Security Agent handles vulnerability scanning
- Architect Agent makes design decisions
- Coder Agent implements changes
- Tester Agent validates everything
- Documentation Agent creates all docs

---

## Customization Guide

### 1. Understand Agent Specifications

Read the agent markdown files in the `agents/` directory to understand their capabilities and workflows. Each agent has detailed sections on:
- Responsibilities
- Workflows
- Success criteria
- Best practices
- Anti-patterns

### 2. Use with /modernize Commands

The agents work together through the modernization commands:
- `/modernize-assess`: Security + Architect agents assess project
- `/modernize-plan`: Coordinator + Architect create detailed plan
- `/modernize-project`: All agents work together through 7 phases

### 3. Customize for Your Project

Agents automatically adapt to your technology stack by:
- Detecting your framework and dependencies
- Adjusting security scans for your ecosystem
- Using appropriate testing tools
- Generating stack-specific documentation

---

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Coordinator, Multiple Workers

```
migration-coordinator (orchestrates)
  ├─> security-agent (Stage 1: Security fixes)
  ├─> coder-agent (Stage 2-N: Code migration)
  ├─> tester-agent (After each stage: Validation)
  └─> documentation-agent (Final stage: Documentation)
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution

```
migration-coordinator
  ├─> coder-agent (Project A)
  ├─> coder-agent (Project B)
  ├─> coder-agent (Project C)
  └─> tester-agent (Validates all)
```

### Pattern 3: Feedback Loop

```
coder-agent → tester-agent (tests)
               ↓ (if failures)
            coder-agent (fixes)
               ↓ (retest)
            tester-agent
               ↓ (if pass)
         documentation-agent
```

## Success Metrics by Agent

| Agent | Key Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Coordinator | Stages complete | 100% | All |
| Security | Security score | ≥85/100 | CRITICAL/HIGH = 0 |
| Coder | Build success | 100% | 100% |
| Tester | Unit pass rate | ≥95% | ≥85% |
| Tester | Integration pass rate | ≥90% | ≥80% |
| Documentation | Docs complete | 100% | All breaking changes |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always use coordinator** - Don't run agents independently without coordination
2. **Follow workflows** - Each agent has a defined workflow (1-5 phases)
3. **Enforce success criteria** - Don't proceed unless criteria met
4. **Document everything** - All agents must log to HISTORY.md
5. **Fix-and-retest** - Never skip retesting after fixes
6. **Parallel when possible** - Spawn multiple agents for independent work
7. **Sequential when required** - Some stages must complete before others start

---

## Common Customizations

### For Web Applications
- Add **e2e-tester-agent** (Selenium/Playwright)
- Customize security patterns for OWASP Top 10
- Add deployment validation to tester

### For Libraries/SDKs
- Add **api-compatibility-agent** (backward compatibility checks)
- Focus coder-agent on public API surface
- Add multi-framework testing to tester

### For Microservices
- Add **contract-tester-agent** (API contracts)
- Add service mesh configuration to coder
- Add distributed tracing to tester

### For Enterprise
- Add compliance checks to security-agent
- Add approval workflows to coordinator
- Add deployment runbooks to documentation-agent

---

## Example: Complete Modernization Flow

The `/modernize-project` command orchestrates a complete workflow:

**Phase 0: Discovery & Assessment**
- Coordinator + Security + Architect analyze project
- Baseline metrics captured
- Quality gates defined

**Phase 1: Security Remediation**
- Security Agent scans and fixes CVEs
- Must achieve security score ≥45
- Tester Agent validates no regressions

**Phases 2-6: Framework & Code Modernization**
- Architect creates ADRs
- Coder Agent(s) implement changes in parallel
- Tester Agent enforces 100% pass rate after each change
- Quality gates block progression if criteria not met

**Phase 7: Documentation & Validation**
- Documentation Agent creates CHANGELOG, migration guide
- Final testing across all test types
- Coordinator performs GO/NO-GO decision

---

## Summary

The agents work together as a coordinated team to modernize software projects. Each agent has a specific role and expertise:

- **Coordinator**: Orchestrates the entire workflow
- **Security**: Ensures security vulnerabilities are addressed
- **Architect**: Makes technology and design decisions
- **Coder**: Implements changes and migrations
- **Tester**: Validates quality with comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Captures all decisions and changes

Use the `/modernize-*` commands to leverage these agents for systematic project modernization.
