# ADR Lifecycle Protocol

**Version**: 1.1
**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Purpose**: Ensure ADRs are living documents updated throughout the decision lifecycle
**Applicability**: All architectural decisions in any .NET project

---

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are **living documents** that must be updated throughout the entire decision lifecycle, from initial research through implementation and post-implementation review. This protocol ensures ADRs accurately reflect the evolution of architectural decisions and serve as reliable historical records.

---

## ADR File Naming Convention (MANDATORY)

**All ADR files MUST follow this exact naming pattern**:

```
ADR #### Title With Spaces.md
```

**Format Rules**:
- Prefix: `ADR` (uppercase, with space after)
- Number: Four digits with leading zeros (`0001`, `0002`, `0042`, `1234`)
- Space after number
- Title: Human-readable title with spaces between words (Title Case)
- Extension: `.md`

### ✅ Correct Examples

```
ADR 0001 Target Framework NET9.md
ADR 0002 RabbitMQ Client Upgrade.md
ADR 0003 ZeroFormatter Deprecation.md
ADR 0015 Dependency Injection Container Selection.md
ADR 0042 Serialization Enricher Strategy.md
```

### ❌ Incorrect Examples

```
0001-target-framework-net9.md          ❌ No ADR prefix, uses dashes
adr-0002-rabbitmq-upgrade.md            ❌ Lowercase, uses dashes
ADR 0003 ZeroFormatter-Deprecation.md   ❌ Uses dashes instead of spaces
ADR0004Ninject.md                       ❌ No spaces
ADR 04 Short Title.md                   ❌ Only 2 digits (need 4)
```

### Rationale

- **Readability**: Spaces make titles easier to read in file browsers
- **Sortability**: Four-digit numbers ensure proper alphanumeric sorting (0001 comes before 0100)
- **Consistency**: Single standard prevents confusion
- **Searchability**: "ADR ####" pattern easy to grep/search

### Creating New ADR

```bash
# Get next ADR number
LAST_ADR=$(ls docs/adr/ADR\ *.md | tail -1 | sed 's/.*ADR //' | sed 's/ .*//')
NEXT_NUM=$(printf "%04d" $((10#$LAST_ADR + 1)))

# Create new ADR with correct naming
touch "docs/adr/ADR $NEXT_NUM Your Decision Title.md"
```

### Enforcement

Agents MUST:
- Use correct naming when creating ADRs
- Rename any incorrectly named ADRs discovered
- Document the naming convention in project README/CLAUDE.md

---

## ADR Lifecycle Stages

### Stage 1: Problem Identification → Status: `proposed`

**When**: As soon as an architectural decision need is identified

**Actions**:
1. Create initial ADR with status `proposed`
2. Document the problem/context clearly
3. List initial decision drivers (constraints, requirements)
4. Identify preliminary alternatives (minimum 1-2 initially)

**ADR Content**:
```markdown
# ADR ####: [Decision Title]

## Status

proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

[Clear description of the architectural problem requiring a decision]

## Decision Drivers

* [Initial constraint 1]
* [Initial requirement 1]
* [More to be added during research]

## Considered Options

* [Option 1 - preliminary]
* [Option 2 - preliminary]
* [More options to be researched]

## Decision Outcome

**NOT YET DECIDED** - Research in progress

## Notes

- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Next steps: Research alternatives, evaluate options
```

**Example**:
```markdown
# ADR-0015: Dependency Injection Container Selection

## Status

proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

Project currently supports multiple DI containers (Autofac, Ninject, Microsoft DI).
Need to decide which containers to maintain for modern .NET compatibility.

## Decision Drivers

* Modern .NET compatibility
* Community adoption and maintenance
* Migration effort for users
* Performance characteristics

## Considered Options

* Keep all three (Autofac, Ninject, Microsoft DI)
* Deprecate Ninject, keep Autofac and Microsoft DI
* Microsoft DI only
* [More research needed]

## Decision Outcome

**NOT YET DECIDED** - Research in progress

## Notes

- Created: 2025-10-12
- Next steps: Research Ninject modern .NET compatibility, evaluate Autofac adoption
```

---

### Stage 2: Research Phase → Status: `proposed` (updated)

**When**: During active research of alternatives

**Actions**:
1. Update ADR with each alternative researched
2. Add pros/cons as discovered
3. Document research sources
4. Add evaluation criteria
5. Create evaluation matrix (preliminary scores)

**Frequency**: Update ADR after researching each alternative (incremental updates)

**ADR Updates**:
```markdown
## Considered Options

* Option 1: [Name]
* Option 2: [Name]
* Option 3: [Name]
* Option 4: [Name]

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: [Name]

[Research findings]

* Good, because [researched benefit A]
* Good, because [researched benefit B]
* Bad, because [discovered limitation C]
* Bad, because [discovered limitation D]

[Repeat for each option]

## Research Sources

* [Official documentation URL]
* [GitHub repository - stars, activity, issues]
* [Benchmark results]
* [Community discussions]

## Evaluation Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | High | ?/5 | 4/5 | ?/5 | 3/5 |
| Maintainability | High | ?/5 | ?/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| [More criteria] | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Status**: Research ongoing, scores incomplete
```

**Commit Message**: `docs: Update ADR #### with [Option Name] research findings`

---

### Stage 3: Evaluation Complete → Status: `proposed` (evaluation ready)

**When**: All alternatives researched, evaluation matrix complete

**Actions**:
1. Complete evaluation matrix with all scores
2. Calculate weighted scores
3. Document trade-offs
4. Add preliminary recommendation
5. **DO NOT change status to `accepted` yet**

**ADR Updates**:
```markdown
## Evaluation Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | High | 4/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 |
| Maintainability | High | 3/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| Migration Cost | Medium | 5/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 | 4/5 |
| Community Support | High | 5/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **4.3** | **3.9** | **4.5** | **3.4** |

## Preliminary Recommendation

Based on evaluation, **Option 3** appears most favorable:
- Highest weighted score (4.5/5)
- Best performance and maintainability
- Strong community support
- Trade-off: Higher migration cost (acceptable given long-term benefits)

**Decision pending stakeholder review and final approval.**
```

**Commit Message**: `docs: Complete ADR #### evaluation matrix and preliminary recommendation`

---

### Stage 4: Decision Made → Status: `accepted` or `rejected`

**When**: Final decision approved (by team lead, architect, stakeholders)

**Actions**:
1. **Update status** to `accepted` or `rejected`
2. Document final decision outcome
3. Document decision rationale
4. List positive and negative consequences
5. Add implementation plan outline
6. **Log to HISTORY.md** via `append-to-history.sh`
7. Update ADR index (docs/ADR/README.md)

**ADR Updates**:
```markdown
## Status

accepted

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Option 3: [Name]**", because:
- Highest evaluation score (4.5/5)
- Best long-term maintainability and performance
- Strong community support ensures future viability

  "Reviewed ADR #### ([Decision Title]) 3 months post-implementation. Outcomes: Performance +18% (predicted +15-20% ✅), migration effort 14h (predicted 12-16h ✅), bug rate -40% (predicted -20% ✅ EXCEEDED), team satisfaction 8.5/10 (target >7/10 ✅). All success criteria met or exceeded. Unexpected benefits: [list]. Unexpected challenges: [list]. Would decide same again: YES." \
  "Validate architectural decision outcomes and learn from implementation experience. Ensure predictions were accurate and decision was sound. Inform future similar decisions." \
  "ADR #### validated as successful decision. Predictions accurate. Exceeded expectations on maintainability. Lessons learned documented for future decisions. Follow-up: [any recommendations]."
```

**Commit Message**: `docs: Add ADR #### post-implementation review (successful, all criteria met)`

---

### Stage 7: Superseded/Deprecated → Status: `superseded` or `deprecated`

**When**: Decision is replaced by new approach or no longer recommended

**Actions**:
1. Update status to `superseded by ADR-YYYY` or `deprecated`
2. Document why decision changed
3. Link to replacement ADR (if superseded)
4. Add deprecation timeline
5. Create migration guide (if needed)

**ADR Updates**:
```markdown
## Status

superseded by [ADR-YYYY](ADR-YYYY-new-approach.md)

## Supersession Information

### Superseded Date
YYYY-MM-DD

### Reason for Supersession

Original decision (Option 3) worked well for 2 years but new requirements emerged:
- Requirement 1: [New need not addressed by Option 3]
- Requirement 2: [New need not addressed by Option 3]
- Technology evolution: [New Option 5 emerged with better capabilities]

### Replacement Decision

See [ADR-YYYY: New Approach for [Problem]](ADR-YYYY-new-approach.md) for replacement decision.

### Migration Timeline

- **Deprecation announced**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Support ends**: YYYY-MM-DD (12 months)
- **Removal target**: YYYY-MM-DD (24 months)

### Migration Path

See [Migration Guide: Option 3 → New Approach](../migration/option3-to-new-approach.md)

## Historical Context

This ADR documents a decision that was **correct at the time** (2025-10-12) but has since been superseded due to:
- Changed requirements
- Technology evolution
- Better alternatives emerged

**Original decision rationale remains valid for historical context.**
```

**Commit Message**: `docs: Supersede ADR #### (replaced by ADR-YYYY - [new approach])`

## Protocol Enforcement

### For Architect Agents

**Before making ANY architectural decision:**
1. Check if ADR exists for this decision area
2. If YES: Update existing ADR (don't create duplicate)
3. If NO: Create new ADR with status `proposed`

**During research:**
1. Update ADR incrementally as alternatives researched
2. Commit after each alternative added (granular history)

**When decision made:**
1. Update status to `accepted`
2. Log to HISTORY.md (MANDATORY)
3. Update ADR index

**During implementation:**
1. Add implementation notes to ADR
2. Document deviations and challenges

**Post-implementation (1-3 months):**
1. Conduct review
2. Update ADR with outcomes
3. Log review to HISTORY.md

### For Coder Agents

**Before implementing architectural change:**
1. Check for relevant ADR
2. If no ADR exists: Request architect agent create one
3. Implement per ADR guidance

**During implementation:**
1. Note deviations from ADR plan
2. Report challenges to architect agent for ADR update

**After implementation:**
1. Report actual effort vs. predicted
2. Provide feedback for post-implementation review

### For Migration Coordinator

**Planning phase:**
1. Ensure all major architectural decisions have ADRs
2. Create ADR stubs for decisions to be made

**Execution phase:**
1. Verify ADRs updated as decisions made
2. Enforce logging protocol

**Review phase:**
1. Schedule post-implementation reviews

## Benefits of Lifecycle-Aware ADRs

1. **Living Documentation**: ADRs evolve with decisions, not written once and forgotten
2. **Complete History**: See how decision evolved from research → decision → implementation → review
3. **Accountability**: Each update shows what was known when decision was made
4. **Learning**: Post-implementation reviews validate predictions and inform future decisions
5. **Transparency**: Incremental updates show research process and alternatives considered
6. **Auditability**: Git history + HISTORY.md provide complete decision audit trail
7. **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members understand decision rationale and outcomes
8. **Decision Quality**: Structured lifecycle prevents hasty decisions

---

## Integration with Existing Protocols

### Agent Logging Protocol
- **When**: ADR created, major updates, decision made, review complete
- **How**: Use Template 4 (Architectural Decision) in GENERIC-AGENT-LOGGING-PROTOCOL.md
- **Frequency**: Log ADR creation and acceptance; optionally log major research updates

### Testing Protocol
- **When**: Post-implementation review
- **How**: Include test results, bug rates, performance data in review
- **Metrics**: Use from GENERIC-TESTING-PROTOCOL.md

### Migration Planning
- **When**: Planning phase
- **How**: Create ADR stubs for decisions to be made during migration
- **Tracking**: ADRs track architectural decisions throughout migration stages
