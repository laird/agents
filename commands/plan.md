# Plan Command

**Description**: Create a detailed modernization strategy and execution plan, utilizing assessment.md if available, with phase breakdown, timeline, and resource allocation

---

# Project Modernization Planning Protocol

**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive, actionable modernization plan
**Input**: Optional `assessment.md` from `/modernize-assess`
**Output**: `plan.md` with detailed execution strategy
**Duration**: 3-6 hours

**Note**: Time estimates are based on typical human execution times and may vary significantly based on project complexity, team experience, and AI assistance capabilities.

---

## Overview

This protocol creates a **detailed modernization execution plan** that serves as the blueprint for the `/modernize-project` command. The plan includes:
- ✅ Detailed phase breakdown with tasks
- ✅ Timeline and milestone schedule
- ✅ Resource allocation and team assignments
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Quality gates and success criteria
- ✅ Contingency plans

**Core Principle**: **Proper planning prevents poor performance - plan before you execute.**

---

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Load Assessment (if available)

```bash
# Check for assessment.md
if [ -f "assessment.md" ]; then
    echo "✅ Found assessment.md - using as input"
    # Extract: scores, risks, estimates, recommendations
else
    echo "⚠️ No assessment.md found - will create basic assessment"
    # Run abbreviated assessment inline
fi
```

**If assessment exists**:
- Use technical viability score
- Use identified risks
- Use effort estimates
- Use team capacity analysis
- Use dependency analysis

**If no assessment**:
- Create quick assessment (30 min)
- Gather basic project info
- Identify major risks
- Rough effort estimate

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: With Assessment

```
User: /modernize-plan
Claude: Checking for assessment.md...
✅ Found assessment.md (score: 78/100, PROCEED WITH CAUTION)

Using assessment findings:
- Technical Viability: 82/100
- Business Value: 74/100
- Risk Profile: MEDIUM (3 HIGH risks)
- Estimated Effort: 22-28 days

Creating detailed plan...

[Generates comprehensive plan based on assessment]

Phase 0: Discovery (2 days)
- Already have baseline from assessment
- Focus on detailed breaking changes
- Estimated: 2 days vs 1-2 days typical

Phase 1: Security (3-5 days)
- Assessment identified 3 CRITICAL, 12 HIGH CVEs
- [Detailed remediation plan]

[Continues through all phases]

✅ plan.md created (47 pages)

Summary:
- Duration: 24 weeks
- Team: 3 developers
- Milestones: 8 quality gates
- Timeline includes 30% contingency buffer
```

### Example 2: Without Assessment

```
User: /modernize-plan
Claude: No assessment.md found.
Running quick assessment first...

[30-minute abbreviated assessment]

Quick Assessment Results:
- Project Size: Medium (~35k LOC)
- Current: .NET 6
- Target: .NET 9
- Rough Estimate: 25-35 days

⚠️ Recommendation: Run full /modernize-assess for better accuracy

Creating plan with conservative estimates...

[Generates plan with wider ranges]

✅ plan.md created

Note: This plan has wider time/cost ranges due to limited assessment.
Consider running /modernize-assess for refined planning.
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Assessment** - Always run `/modernize-assess` first
2. **Be Realistic** - Conservative estimates prevent disappointment
3. **Include Buffer** - 30% contingency is standard
4. **Define Gates** - Clear decision points prevent drift
5. **Plan Contingencies** - Murphy's law applies
6. **Get Buy-in** - Review plan with all stakeholders before execution
