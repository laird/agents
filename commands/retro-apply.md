# Retro-Apply Command

**Description**: Apply the process improvement recommendations from IMPROVEMENTS.md to agent protocols and project configuration

---

# Retrospective Application Protocol

**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Apply approved process improvements from IMPROVEMENTS.md to agent protocols
**Team**: All specialist agents (Migration Coordinator, Security, Architect, Coder, Tester, Documentation)
**Input**: `IMPROVEMENTS.md` (from `/retro` command)
**Output**: Updated protocol files, configuration, automation scripts
**Duration**: 3-8 hours (depends on recommendation complexity)

**Note**: Time estimates are based on typical human execution times and may vary significantly based on project complexity, team experience, and AI assistance capabilities.

---

## Overview

This protocol **systematically implements** the process improvements documented in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`, including:
- **Agent behavioral changes**: Update command files to guide better agent behavior (tool usage, confirmation patterns, context gathering)
- **Protocol updates**: Modify process steps, quality gates, workflow sequences
- **Automation**: Add scripts, hooks, CI/CD to enforce improvements
- **Documentation**: Update guidelines, examples, anti-patterns

**Core Principle**: **Make improvements permanent by embedding them in protocols, commands, and automation.**

**Change Types**:
- **Agent Behavior**: Update commands/*.md to teach agents better practices
- **Protocol**: Modify process flows in protocol documents
- **Automation**: Add enforcement through scripts/hooks
- **Tool Usage**: Add examples and guidance for proper tool selection
- **Confirmation Patterns**: Add user approval checkpoints

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Input

**IMPROVEMENTS.md must exist** with:
- ✅ 3-5 specific recommendations
- ✅ Each recommendation has clear implementation steps
- ✅ ADR format with problem, evidence, proposed change
- ✅ Status: Proposed or Approved

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check for IMPROVEMENTS.md
if [ ! -f "IMPROVEMENTS.md" ]; then
    echo "❌ IMPROVEMENTS.md not found"
    echo "Run /retro first to generate recommendations"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate format
grep -q "## Recommendations" IMPROVEMENTS.md || echo "⚠️ Missing Recommendations section"
grep -q "## Summary" IMPROVEMENTS.md || echo "⚠️ Missing Summary section"
```

---

## Application Process

### Phase 1: Review and Approval (15-30 minutes)

**Objective**: Ensure recommendations are approved before implementation

#### 1.1 Display Recommendations

**Migration Coordinator**:
```bash
# Extract and display all recommendations
cat IMPROVEMENTS.md | awk '/^### Recommendation/,/^---/ {print}'
```

**Present to User**:
```markdown
## Recommendations to Apply

### Summary
| # | Recommendation | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---|----------------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | [Title] | High | Medium | P0 |
| 2 | [Title] | High | Low | P0 |
| 3 | [Title] | Medium | Low | P1 |

Do you want to apply:
- All recommendations?
- Only P0 (high priority)?
- Select specific recommendations?
```

#### 1.2 User Confirmation

**Wait for explicit approval** before proceeding:
- `all` - Apply all recommendations
- `p0` - Apply only P0 priority
- `1,3,5` - Apply specific recommendations by number
- `cancel` - Abort application

**Update Status in IMPROVEMENTS.md**:
```markdown
**Status**: Approved for Implementation
**Approval Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Approved By**: [User]
**Implementation Started**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

---

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Create detailed implementation plan for each recommendation

**Migration Coordinator** analyzes each recommendation and creates execution plan:

#### 2.1 Categorize Changes

**Change Types**:
- **Agent Behavior**: Update command files to change how agents behave (tool selection, confirmation patterns, read-before-write rules)
- **Protocol Updates**: Modify process steps, phases, quality gates in protocol documents
- **Automation**: Add scripts, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD workflows
- **Configuration**: Update project config files
- **Documentation**: Update README, guides, templates, examples
- **Tool Integration**: Install/configure new tools

**Examples**:
- Agent Behavior: "Add 'MUST read file before Write/Edit' rule to commands/modernize.md"
- Protocol: "Add dependency analysis as Phase 0.5 in assessment workflow"
- Automation: "Add pre-commit hook for security scanning"

#### 2.2 Dependency Analysis

**Identify dependencies** between recommendations:
```
Recommendation 3 depends on Recommendation 1
→ Must apply Recommendation 1 first

Recommendation 2 and 4 are independent
→ Can apply in parallel
```

#### 2.3 Risk Assessment

**For each recommendation**:
- Risk Level: Low/Medium/High
- Rollback Plan: How to undo if issues occur
- Validation: How to verify success

#### 2.4 Execution Order

**Create ordered plan**:
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Foundation (P0, no dependencies)
1. Recommendation 2: [Title] - 1 hour
2. Recommendation 1: [Title] - 2 hours

### Phase B: Dependent Changes (P0, requires Phase A)
3. Recommendation 3: [Title] - 1.5 hours

### Phase C: Enhancements (P1)
4. Recommendation 4: [Title] - 2 hours
5. Recommendation 5: [Title] - 1 hour

**Total Estimated Time**: 7.5 hours
```

---

### Phase 3: Apply Protocol Updates (1-4 hours)

**Objective**: Update agent protocol documents with process improvements

**For each recommendation requiring protocol updates**:

#### 3.1 Identify Affected Protocols

**Common protocol locations**:
- `commands/modernize.md` - Main modernization protocol
- `commands/assess.md` - Assessment protocol
- `commands/plan.md` - Planning protocol
- Project-specific protocols

**Example**: Recommendation "Front-load dependency analysis"
- Affects: `commands/assess.md` (add dependency analysis step)
- Affects: `commands/plan.md` (add dependency migration matrix)
- Affects: `commands/modernize.md` (Phase 0 prerequisites)

#### 3.2 Update Protocol Content

**Process**:
1. **Read current protocol**
2. **Identify insertion point** (which section/phase)
3. **Draft update** following protocol format
4. **Insert update** maintaining structure
5. **Validate** syntax and formatting
6. **Document change** in commit message

**Example Protocol Update**:

```markdown
# In commands/modernize.md

## Phase 0: Discovery & Assessment

**NEW - Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 1**:

### 0.5 Dependency Migration Matrix (MANDATORY)

**Duration**: 4-6 hours
**Agent**: Architect Agent (lead) + Security Agent
**BLOCKING**: Must complete before Phase 1

**Activities**:
1. **Enumerate All Dependencies**
   - List every package/library with current version
   - Identify target versions compatible with target framework
   - Document dependencies of dependencies (transitive)

2. **Compatibility Analysis**
   - Check version compatibility matrix
   - Identify known conflicts
   - Research breaking changes for each upgrade
   - **Deliverable**: Dependency compatibility matrix

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**
   - For each conflict, document resolution approach
   - Identify packages needing replacement
   - Define upgrade order (bottom-up from leaf dependencies)
   - **Deliverable**: Dependency upgrade sequence

**Exit Criteria**:
- ✅ All dependencies mapped to target versions
- ✅ All conflicts identified with resolution strategy
- ✅ Upgrade order defined
- ✅ No unknowns remaining

**Why This Change**:
[Link to IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 1]
Prevents mid-migration dependency conflicts that historically caused 1-2 week delays.
```

**Example Agent Behavioral Update**:

```markdown
# In commands/modernize.md

## Agent Best Practices

**NEW - Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 4**:

### MANDATORY: Read Before Write/Edit

**Rule**: ALL agents MUST read a file before using Write or Edit tools.

**Rationale**: Prevents overwriting existing content, conflicts, and user interruptions.
Historical evidence: 8 instances of conflicts caused by writing without reading first.

**Protocol**:
1. **Before Write**: ALWAYS use Read tool first
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: Use Write without reading
   ✅ CORRECT: Read → analyze content → Write
   ```

2. **Before Edit**: File must be read in current conversation
   ```
   ❌ WRONG: Edit tool on file never read
   ✅ CORRECT: Read → identify exact string → Edit
   ```

3. **Exceptions**: NONE. This rule has no exceptions.

**Enforcement**:
- Migration Coordinator validates all file operations
- User should interrupt if agent violates this rule
- Retrospective will flag violations

**Examples**:
```
User: Update the config file
Agent: [Reads config.json first]
Agent: I see the current configuration has X, Y, Z settings.
Agent: I'll update setting Y to the new value.
Agent: [Uses Edit tool with exact old_string from what was read]
```

**Why This Change**:
[Link to IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 4]
Eliminates 100% of file conflicts and user interruptions caused by not reading files first.
```

**Example Tool Usage Behavioral Update**:

```markdown
# In commands/modernize.md

## Tool Selection Guide

**NEW - Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 5**:

### Use Specialized Tools, Not Bash Commands

**Rule**: Use specialized tools for file operations, NOT bash commands.

**Decision Tree**:

**Need to read file?**
- ✅ Use: `Read` tool
- ❌ Don't use: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`
- **Why**: Read provides line numbers, handles large files, integrates with Edit

**Need to find files?**
- ✅ Use: `Glob` tool with pattern
- ❌ Don't use: `find`, `ls`
- **Why**: Glob is faster, respects .gitignore, returns sorted results

**Need to search file contents?**
- ✅ Use: `Grep` tool
- ❌ Don't use: `grep`, `rg`, `ag`
- **Why**: Grep has better permissions, output modes, context options

**Need to create/modify files?**
- ✅ Use: `Write`, `Edit` tools
- ❌ Don't use: `echo >`, `cat <<EOF`, `sed`, `awk`
- **Why**: Write/Edit are tracked, validated, support rollback

**Only use Bash for**:
- Git operations
- Build commands (npm, dotnet, make)
- Test execution
- System commands that aren't file operations

**Historical Evidence**:
- 23 instances of `cat` instead of Read
- 15 instances of `find` instead of Glob
- 12 instances of `grep` instead of Grep
- All required user corrections

**Why This Change**:
[Link to IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 5]
Reduces wrong tool usage by 95%, improves context handling, eliminates user corrections.
```

#### 3.3 Validate Updates

**Checks**:
- [ ] Markdown syntax valid
- [ ] Section numbering consistent
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Formatting matches protocol style
- [ ] No broken references

---

### Phase 4: Add Automation (1-3 hours)

**Objective**: Implement automation to enforce improvements

**Common Automation Types**:

#### 4.1 Pre-commit Hooks

**Example**: Automated security scanning

**Create**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` or use husky/lefthook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook: Security vulnerability scanning
# Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 3

echo "🔍 Scanning for security vulnerabilities..."

# Detect project type and run appropriate scanner
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    npm audit --audit-level=high
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ Security vulnerabilities detected (HIGH or above)"
        echo "Run 'npm audit fix' or document exceptions"
        exit 1
    fi
elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
    pip-audit
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ Security vulnerabilities detected"
        exit 1
    fi
elif [ -f "*.csproj" ]; then
    dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ Security vulnerabilities detected"
        exit 1
    fi
fi

echo "✅ No high/critical vulnerabilities detected"
exit 0
```

**Make executable**:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### 4.2 Scripts for Common Tasks

**Example**: Dependency analysis script

**Create**: `scripts/analyze-dependencies.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Dependency Analysis Script
# Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 1

echo "📦 Dependency Analysis for Modernization"
echo "========================================"

# Detect project type
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "Project Type: Node.js"
    echo ""
    echo "Outdated Packages:"
    npm outdated --long
    echo ""
    echo "Dependency Tree:"
    npm list --depth=1
elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
    echo "Project Type: Python"
    echo ""
    echo "Outdated Packages:"
    pip list --outdated
elif [ -f "*.sln" ]; then
    echo "Project Type: .NET"
    echo ""
    echo "Outdated Packages:"
    dotnet list package --outdated --include-transitive
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ Save this output to inform dependency migration matrix"
```

**Make executable**:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/analyze-dependencies.sh
```

#### 4.3 CI/CD Integration

**Example**: Add security scanning to GitHub Actions

**Create/Update**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

```yaml
name: Security Vulnerability Scan
# Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 3

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Monday at 9am UTC
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run security scan
      run: |
        # Auto-detect project type and scan
        if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
          npm audit --audit-level=moderate
        elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
          pip install pip-audit
          pip-audit
        elif [ -f "*.csproj" ]; then
          dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive
        fi

    - name: Upload results
      if: failure()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: security-scan-results
        path: security-scan.log
```

#### 4.4 Quality Gate Automation

**Example**: Test coverage enforcement

**Create**: `scripts/enforce-coverage.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test Coverage Quality Gate
# Added from IMPROVEMENTS.md Recommendation 4

REQUIRED_COVERAGE=85

echo "📊 Checking test coverage..."

# Run tests with coverage
# (adapt to project type)
COVERAGE=$(npm test -- --coverage | grep "All files" | awk '{print $10}' | sed 's/%//')

if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $REQUIRED_COVERAGE" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "❌ Coverage $COVERAGE% is below required $REQUIRED_COVERAGE%"
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ Coverage $COVERAGE% meets requirement"
    exit 0
fi
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Applying without approval** - Always get user confirmation first
❌ **Partial application** - If starting, complete all approved recommendations
❌ **No validation** - Always test scripts and automation before committing
❌ **Poor documentation** - Document what changed and why in commits
❌ **No rollback plan** - Always know how to undo changes
❌ **Ignoring dependencies** - Apply recommendations in correct order
❌ **Breaking existing workflows** - Ensure changes are backward compatible

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Recommendation unclear or ambiguous

**Solution**:
- Ask user for clarification
- Update IMPROVEMENTS.md with clearer description
- Don't guess at implementation

### Issue: Automation script fails validation

**Solution**:
- Debug script
- Test in isolation
- Don't commit broken automation
- Document issue in IMPROVEMENTS.md

### Issue: Protocol update creates inconsistency

**Solution**:
- Review full protocol for consistency
- Update related sections
- Validate all internal links
- Check examples align with changes

### Issue: Merge conflicts in protocols

**Solution**:
- Manually resolve conflicts
- Prioritize new improvements
- Validate merged result
- Test all changes
