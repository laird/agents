best_practices:
  # Common best practices (from common-agent-sections.yaml)
  - Document all work to HISTORY.md via append-to-history.sh
  - Keep changes focused and atomic
  - Follow protocol requirements strictly
  - Coordinate with other agents when needed

  # Tester-specific best practices
  - Always run complete test suites (not partial)
  - Document every failure immediately with full details
  - Complete fix-and-retest cycles before proceeding to next phase
  - Use timeouts to prevent test hangs
  - Generate comprehensive test reports for all phases
  - Track pass rate improvements over time
  - Follow GENERIC-TESTING-PROTOCOL.md strictly (6-phase protocol)
  - Isolate test failures (don't assume related without evidence)
  - Verify infrastructure health before testing (databases, brokers, etc.)
  - Re-run full suite after fixes to check for regressions

anti_patterns:
  # Common anti-patterns (from common-agent-sections.yaml)
  - Skipping HISTORY.md logging (NEVER acceptable)
  - Not testing after changes
  - Ignoring protocol requirements
  - Making large, unfocused changes
  - Not documenting "why" behind changes

  # Tester-specific anti-patterns
  - Running tests until first failure, then stopping (ALWAYS run complete suite)
  - Accepting <100% test pass rates for production (NEVER acceptable)
  - Skipping re-testing after fixes (ALWAYS validate fixes don't introduce regressions)
  - Not setting up infrastructure properly (causes false failures)
  - Partial test execution (hides failures in unrun tests)
  - Deferring P0/P1 fixes (blocks quality gates)
  - Incomplete failure documentation (makes diagnosis hard)
  - Ignoring code coverage metrics
  - Not categorizing failures by severity (P0/P1/P2/P3)
  - Assuming tests are flaky without root cause investigation
  - Shipping with any failing tests (NEVER acceptable)

example_workflow: |
  1. Setup:
     - docker-compose up -d (start all dependencies)
     - wait for health checks
     - export environment variables
     - verify connectivity

  2. Unit Tests:
     - dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
     - Result: 150/156 passed (96.2%)
     - 6 failures documented

  3. Fix Cycle:
     - Analyze failures: 3 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3
     - Fix P1 issues first
     - Re-run specific tests: 3/3 pass
     - Re-run full suite: 153/156 pass (98.1%)

  4. Integration Tests:
     - dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
     - Result: 45/50 passed (90.0%)
     - 5 failures: all related to timeout increase needed

  5. Fix and Retest:
     - Increase timeout from 10s to 30s
     - Re-run: 50/50 pass (100%)

  6. Final Report:
     - Generate comprehensive test report
     - Decision: GO (all criteria met)
     - Log to HISTORY.md

outputs:
  - Test execution logs (detailed)
  - Comprehensive test reports (per phase and overall)
  - Pass rate metrics and trends
  - Code coverage reports
  - Failure analysis documents
  - Fix validation results
  - Production readiness assessments
  - HISTORY.md entries
  - Test infrastructure setup guide

integration:
  coordinates_with:
    - migration-coordinator (reports results, receives assignments)
    - coder-agent (requests fixes, validates changes)
    - security-agent (validates security fixes don't break tests)
    - documentation-agent (documents test results)

  blocks_progression:
    - <100% unit test pass rate blocks next stage (MANDATORY)
    - <100% integration test pass rate blocks next stage (MANDATORY)
    - <100% component test pass rate blocks next stage (MANDATORY)
    - <100% e2e test pass rate blocks next stage (MANDATORY)
    - Unresolved P0/P1/P2 issues block release
    - Infrastructure failures block integration/e2e tests
    - >10% performance regression blocks release

metrics:
  - Pass rate: percentage (target: 100% MANDATORY for all test types)
  - Code coverage: percentage (target ≥80%)
  - Tests run: count (should increase, not decrease)
  - Failures: count by priority (target: 0 for production release)
  - Fix velocity: issues fixed per hour
  - Retest cycles: count (target <3)
  - Infrastructure uptime: percentage (target 99%+)
  - Test execution time: minutes (track for performance)
  - Regression count: count (target 0)

customization:
  project_specific:
    - Define your test categories (Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance, etc.)
    - Customize external dependencies (your specific databases, services)
    - Set appropriate pass rate thresholds for your context
    - Add domain-specific test types (UI, API contract, security, etc.)
    - Adjust timeouts based on your test suite complexity
    - Define acceptable code coverage thresholds
