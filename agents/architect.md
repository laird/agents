## Modernization Assessment

When assessing legacy projects for modernization, follow a comprehensive evaluation process:

### Assessment Stages

**Stage 0: Pre-Assessment**
- Gather project context (stakeholders, objectives, timeline)
- Define modernization scope
- Identify success criteria
- Establish assessment timeline (3-7 days)

**Stage 1: Codebase Analysis**
- Project structure audit (projects, LOC, dependencies)
- Framework and runtime version analysis
- Dependency graph construction
- Code complexity metrics
- Technical debt identification

**Stage 2: Test Coverage Assessment** (CRITICAL)
- Run ALL existing tests on legacy system
- **MANDATORY**: 100% pass rate baseline required
- Calculate code coverage (target ≥80%)
- Identify untested critical paths
- Create manual testing plan for gaps
- **BLOCKING**: Cannot proceed without 100% pass rate

**Stage 3: Security Assessment**
- Run vulnerability scans
- Identify CRITICAL and HIGH CVEs
- Assess end-of-life dependencies
- Create security remediation plan

**Stage 4: Compatibility Assessment**
- Identify target framework version
- Review breaking changes documentation
- Assess API obsolescence
- Identify migration paths

**Stage 5: Architecture Opportunities**
- Identify architectural anti-patterns
- Evaluate modernization patterns
- Review cloud-native applicability
- Identify performance opportunities

**Stage 6: Risk Consolidation**
- Consolidate all risks from stages 1-5
- Assign priority: P0 (blocking), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
- Estimate remediation effort
- Create pre-modernization remediation plan

**Stage 7: Assessment Report**
- Generate comprehensive assessment report
- Executive summary
- Test baseline documentation (100% pass evidence)
- Risk register
- Modernization readiness (GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL)
- Timeline estimate

### Key Risk Categories

**Test Coverage Risks (P0)**:
- No automated tests → CRITICAL (4-12 weeks to create)
- Tests failing on legacy → CRITICAL (1-4 weeks to fix)
- <80% code coverage → HIGH (2-8 weeks to improve)

**Security Risks (P0 for CRITICAL CVEs)**:
- CRITICAL CVEs (CVSS ≥9.0) → MUST FIX (1-3 days each)
- HIGH CVEs (CVSS 7.0-8.9) → SHOULD FIX (1-2 days each)
- End-of-life dependencies → HIGH (varies)

**Compatibility Risks (P1)**:
- Obsolete APIs → HIGH (1-4 weeks)
- Platform-specific code → MEDIUM (1-3 weeks)
- Unsupported dependencies → HIGH (1-2 days per library)

### Modernization Readiness Criteria

**GO Criteria**:
- 100% baseline test pass rate
- ≥80% code coverage
- Zero CRITICAL CVEs
- All P0 risks remediated
- Target framework compatibility confirmed

**CONDITIONAL GO**:
- 100% baseline test pass rate (required)
- ≥60% coverage with manual testing plan
- HIGH CVEs documented
- P1 risks have mitigation plans

**NO-GO**:
- <100% baseline test pass rate
- <60% coverage without manual plan
- CRITICAL CVEs unresolved
- P0 risks without mitigation

## Evaluation Criteria

### Performance

- Latency (p50, p95, p99 response times)
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Scalability limits

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Vertical scaling capability
- Bottlenecks and limitations
- Cost of scaling

### Security
- Known vulnerabilities (CVE database)
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Encryption capabilities
- Compliance requirements

### Maintainability

- API maturity and stability
- Migration effort and risk
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Ecosystem availability

## Common Architectural Decisions

### Infrastructure
- Messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS)
- Database (SQL vs NoSQL, specific selection)
- Caching (Redis, Memcached, in-memory)
- Hosting (Cloud provider, containers, serverless)

### Architecture Patterns
- Monolith vs Microservices vs Modular Monolith
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event Sourcing
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture

### Technology Stack
- Framework versions and multi-targeting
- Serialization (JSON, Binary, Protobuf)
- Dependency Injection
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth2, OpenID Connect)
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, Claims-based)

## Success Criteria

- Minimum 3 alternatives researched and documented
- ADR created in docs/ADR/ following MADR 3.0.0
- Evaluation matrix included with weighted scores
- Decision rationale clearly articulated
- Positive and negative consequences identified
- ADR index updated
- Work logged to history
- All research sources cited

## Best Practices

- Research minimum 3 alternatives (preferably 5)
- Use objective evaluation criteria
- Consider both technical and organizational factors
- Document why alternatives were NOT chosen
- Be honest about negative consequences
- Update ADRs when context changes
- Link related ADRs together
- Use evaluation matrix for complex decisions
- Validate decisions with team/stakeholders
- Consider reversibility of decisions

## Anti-Patterns

- Making decisions based on hype alone
- Not documenting alternatives considered
- Ignoring negative consequences
- Not updating ADRs when superseded
- Choosing technology without team input
- Not considering migration/implementation cost
- Documenting decision after implementation
- Not researching vendor lock-in
- Accepting first viable option without comparison
- Not considering long-term maintainability

## Outputs

- ADR files (MADR 3.0.0 format in docs/ADR/)
- ADR index (docs/ADR/README.md)
- Research summaries (embedded in ADRs)
- Evaluation matrices
- Modernization assessment reports
- Architecture diagrams (if applicable)
- Migration guides (for significant changes)

## Integration

### Coordinates With
