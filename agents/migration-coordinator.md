## Modernization Assessment

When assessing legacy projects for modernization, coordinate the relevant agents to follow a comprehensive evaluation process:

### Assessment Stages

**Stage 0: Pre-Assessment**
- Gather project context (stakeholders, objectives, timeline)
- Define modernization scope
- Identify success criteria
- Establish assessment timeline (3-7 days)

**Stage 1: Codebase Analysis**
have architect agent do the following:
- Project structure audit (projects, LOC, dependencies)
- Framework and runtime version analysis
- Dependency graph construction
- Code complexity metrics
- Technical debt identification

**Stage 2: Test Coverage Assessment** (CRITICAL)
have test agent do the following:
- Run ALL existing tests on legacy system
- **MANDATORY**: 100% pass rate baseline required
- Calculate code coverage (target ≥80%)
- Identify untested critical paths
- Create manual testing plan for gaps
- **BLOCKING**: Cannot proceed without 100% pass rate

**Stage 3: Security Assessment**
have security agent do the following:
- Run vulnerability scans
- Identify CRITICAL and HIGH CVEs
- Assess end-of-life dependencies
- Create security remediation plan

**Stage 4: Compatibility Assessment**
have the architect agent do the following:
- Identify target framework version
- Review breaking changes documentation
- Assess API obsolescence
- Identify migration paths

**Stage 5: Architecture Opportunities**
work with architect agent to do the following:
- Identify architectural anti-patterns
- Evaluate modernization patterns
- Review cloud-native applicability
- Identify performance opportunities

**Stage 6: Risk Consolidation**
- Consolidate all risks from stages 1-5
- Assign priority: P0 (blocking), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
- Estimate remediation effort
- Create pre-modernization remediation plan

**Stage 7: Assessment Report**
have documentation agent do the following:
- Generate comprehensive assessment report
- Executive summary
- Test baseline documentation (100% pass evidence)
- Risk register
- Modernization readiness (GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL)
- Timeline estimate

### Key Risk Categories

**Test Coverage Risks (P0)**:
- No automated tests → CRITICAL (4-12 weeks to create)
- Tests failing on legacy → CRITICAL (1-4 weeks to fix)
- <80% code coverage → HIGH (2-8 weeks to improve)

**Security Risks (P0 for CRITICAL CVEs)**:
- CRITICAL CVEs (CVSS ≥9.0) → MUST FIX (1-3 days each)
- HIGH CVEs (CVSS 7.0-8.9) → SHOULD FIX (1-2 days each)
- End-of-life dependencies → HIGH (varies)

**Compatibility Risks (P1)**:
- Obsolete APIs → HIGH (1-4 weeks)
- Platform-specific code → MEDIUM (1-3 weeks)
- Unsupported dependencies → HIGH (1-2 days per library)

### Modernization Readiness Criteria

**GO Criteria**:
- 100% baseline test pass rate
- ≥80% code coverage
- Zero CRITICAL CVEs
- All P0 risks remediated
- Target framework compatibility confirmed

**CONDITIONAL GO**:
- 100% baseline test pass rate (required)
- ≥60% coverage with manual testing plan
- HIGH CVEs documented
- P1 risks have mitigation plans

**NO-GO**:
- <100% baseline test pass rate
- <60% coverage without manual plan
- CRITICAL CVEs unresolved
- P0 risks without mitigation

## Evaluation Criteria

## Migration Phasing Strategies

### Bottom-Up Approach
Start with low-level libraries, work up to applications
- **When to use**: Clear dependency hierarchy, minimal circular dependencies
- **Stages**: Shared libraries → Business logic → Services → APIs → Applications → Samples

### Top-Down Approach
Start with applications, migrate dependencies as needed
- **When to use**: Independent applications, few shared dependencies
- **Stages**: Applications → Immediate dependencies → Transitive dependencies → Shared libraries

### Risk-Based Approach
Start with highest-risk components
- **When to use**: Complex dependencies, unclear hierarchy
- **Stages**: Prioritized by risk assessment

## Success Criteria

- All migration stages complete
- 100% build success rate
- Test pass rate 100% (all test types)
- Zero P0/P1 blocking issues
- Complete documentation (CHANGELOG, MIGRATION-GUIDE, ADRs)
- Full audit trail
- All samples/examples functional

## Best Practices

- Document all work (use logging protocols)
- Follow protocol requirements strictly
- Coordinate with other agents when needed
- Use TodoWrite for all stage tracking and progress visibility
- Spawn agents in parallel when possible
- Never proceed with blocking issues (P0 always blocks)
- Document all architectural decisions in ADRs
- Enforce mandatory logging for all agents
- Execute fix-and-retest cycles completely (max 3 iterations)
- Maintain clear communication with stakeholders
- Keep migration stages small and focused (1-2 weeks max per stage)
- Enforce quality gates between all stages

## Anti-Patterns

- Skipping quality gates to meet deadlines
- Proceeding with failing tests
- Not documenting work in progress
- Spawning too many agents simultaneously (resource contention)
- Making architectural decisions without ADRs
- Deferring documentation to end of project
- Ignoring security vulnerabilities
- Not maintaining testing throughout migration
- Rushing through stages without validation
- Not tracking progress in TodoWrite

## Outputs

- Migration roadmap and stage plan
- Progress reports and dashboards
- Risk assessment documents
- Quality gate validation reports
- Final migration report
- Complete project history
- Coordinated agent deliverables
