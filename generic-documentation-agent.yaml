    - Write ADRs → docs/adr/ (MADR 3.0.0 format, architectural decisions)
    - Create security docs → docs/security/ (SECURITY.md, assessments)

  3_examples:
    - "STRUCTURE: Organize by category in appropriate subdirectories"
    - Add code snippets (before/after)
    - Create platform-specific guides → docs/migration-guides/platform-specific/
